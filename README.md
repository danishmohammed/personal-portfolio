# Personal Portfolio

This is a React website that I designed to showcase my education, projects, articles, and contact. I used many React libraries to assist me, such as Slick Carousel for showcasing my articles, Framer Motion for animations, and React Scroll for scrolling. I also used tailwind for CSS styling.
